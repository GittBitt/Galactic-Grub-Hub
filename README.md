**Description**:

Galactic Grub Hub is an action, time management food delivery game in which a waiter completes the orders of their needy alien customers. The angry customers will try to attack the waiter when they are too slow, which they are definitely not paid enough to handle. Select the correct otherworldly dish to satisfy your galactic customers and deliver it before the timer runs out. But watch out – frightening enemy minions will do their best to stop you in your tracks. Some special customers will even request you twice!

Purchase helpful upgrades to do more damage and aid you on your journey to becoming the strongest, fastest alien waiter in the galaxy!

**How to play**:

To best avoid getting stuck in walls, try not to move too much while you are attacking. Start by selecting the correct dish that your customers request and bringing it to them before the timer runs out.
